# BorderDestroyer OperaGX Mod
Up to date files of the OperaGX mod that you will see me using on my streams over on Twitch. It was made using the [Official OperaGX Mod Template](https://github.com/opera-gaming/gxmods/tree/main/documentation/Mod_Template) and modified to have a custom live background involving Lily (my AI vTuber) and also my logo. Also features custom sound effects in the style that I would use for my games.

Feel free to modify this mod in any way you want! If you do, any credit would be nice and appreciated
